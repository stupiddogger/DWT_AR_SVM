##Description
This is a partial reproduction of a paper.<br>
Name: Classification of EEG Signals Based on Autoregressive Model and Wavelet Packet Decomposition. <br>
Author: Yong Zhang; Bo Liuï¼›etc <br>
##Method
Use Discrete Wavelet Transform (Waveletpacket Decomposition in the paper) and Autoregressive Model to extract the features of EEG signals. Use Support Vector Machine as classifier.
