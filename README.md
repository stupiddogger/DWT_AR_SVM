## Description
This is a partial reproduction of a paper.<br>
Name: Classification of EEG Signals Based on Autoregressive Model and Wavelet Packet Decomposition. <br>
Author: Zhang Y , Liu B , Ji X , et al. <br>
Neural Processing Letters, 2017, 45(2):365-378.
## Method
Use Discrete Wavelet Transform (Waveletpacket Decomposition in the paper) and Autoregressive Model to extract the features of EEG signals. Use Support Vector Machine as classifier.
## Dataset
BCI Competition 2003 Dataset III
